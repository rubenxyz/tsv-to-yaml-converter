# Python Project Architecture Checklist

## Project Initialization & Structure

### Repository Setup
- [ ] Initialize git repository with meaningful `.gitignore` (use Python template)
- [ ] Create clear directory structure following Python conventions
- [ ] Set up virtual environment (`python -m venv venv` or `poetry`)
- [ ] Pin Python version in `pyproject.toml` or `runtime.txt`
- [ ] Create `README.md` with project description, setup instructions, and usage examples

### Core Project Structure

```

## Environment & Dependencies

### Dependency Management
- [ ] Use `pyproject.toml` for modern Python packaging
- [ ] Separate dev/prod dependencies clearly
- [ ] Lock dependencies with exact versions for production
- [ ] Regular dependency security audits (`pip-audit` or `safety`)
- [ ] Document Python version requirements

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Environment-based configuration (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] Use environment variables for secrets (never commit)
- [ ] Create `.env.example` template
- [ ] Implement proper config validation (pydantic)
- [ ] Log configuration loading and validation

## Code Quality & Standards

### Code Style & Formatting
- [ ] Configure `black` for code formatting
- [ ] Set up `isort` for import sorting
- [ ] Use `flake8` or `ruff` for linting
- [ ] Configure `mypy` for type checking
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks for automated checks
- [ ] Consistent docstring style (Google/NumPy/Sphinx)

### Code Organization
- [ ] Follow SOLID principles
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and custom exceptions
- [ ] Use type hints everywhere (Python 3.9+ syntax)
- [ ] Single responsibility for classes and functions
- [ ] Dependency injection for testability
- [ ] Avoid circular imports

### Architecture Patterns
- [ ] Choose appropriate architecture (MVC, Clean Architecture, etc.)
- [ ] Separate business logic from framework code
- [ ] Use interfaces/protocols for abstraction
- [ ] Implement proper logging throughout
- [ ] Configuration management strategy

## Testing Strategy

### Test Structure
- [ ] Mirror source structure in tests directory
- [ ] Unit tests with `pytest`
- [ ] Integration tests for external dependencies
- [ ] End-to-end tests for critical workflows
- [ ] Test fixtures and factories for data setup

### Test Quality
- [ ] Aim for 80%+ code coverage (but focus on critical paths)
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Mock external dependencies properly
- [ ] Parameterized tests for multiple scenarios
- [ ] Performance/load tests for critical components

### Test Automation
- [ ] GitHub Actions/GitLab CI for automated testing
- [ ] Test multiple Python versions if supporting them
- [ ] Parallel test execution for speed
- [ ] Test coverage reporting and tracking
- [ ] Automated test running on file changes (pytest-watch)

## Security & Performance

### Security Measures
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (use ORMs properly)
- [ ] Secrets management (never in code)
- [ ] Authentication and authorization implementation
- [ ] Regular security dependency updates
- [ ] OWASP security checklist review

### Performance Considerations
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Caching strategy implementation
- [ ] Async/await for I/O bound operations
- [ ] Memory usage profiling
- [ ] Performance monitoring and metrics
- [ ] Rate limiting for APIs

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- [ ] Docstrings for all public functions/classes
- [ ] Type hints serve as inline documentation
- [ ] Complex algorithm explanations
- [ ] Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- [ ] API documentation (if applicable)

### User Documentation
- [ ] Installation and setup guide
- [ ] Usage examples and tutorials
- [ ] Configuration reference
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Contributing guidelines

## Deployment & Operations

### Containerization

## Development Workflow

### Version Control
