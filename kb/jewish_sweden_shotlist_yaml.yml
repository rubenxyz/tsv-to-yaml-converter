              description: "CRANE SHOT over a rural settlement on the outskirts of mid-1700s Stockholm.  The trees stand bare, the ground a patchwork of frozen mud and dead grass. Peasants walk along the muddied paths toward a weathered massive medieval church. In the distance, the sparse skyline of 18th-century Stockholm comes into view—Gamla Stan's clustered rooftops, the spires of church towers piercing the pale sky, and the silhouette of the Royal Palace rising over the city. Along the horizon, thin plumes of smoke curl upward from chimneys in the old town, dissipating into the gray northern air."

              description: "Inside a MEDIEVAL_STONE_CHURCH, the view looks straight down the central aisle toward the west entrance. On the left side of the nave, male peasants sit quietly in the pews, heads bowed in prayer; on the right, female peasants mirror them in solemn devotion. Down the aisle advances a liturgical procession: at the front, a young crucifer carries the processional cross, followed by a SWEDISH_PRIEST in flowing vestments, flanked by catechists and deacons. Behind them, choir members proceed in hushed reverence, their footsteps echoing softly beneath the vaulted arches."
